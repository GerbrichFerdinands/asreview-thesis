# Research Archive 
Gerbrich Ferdinands, 14-05-2020. 

This repository contains the research archive accompanying my Master's thesis project, "Active learning for efficient systematic reviews: Evaluating models across research areas". 


# Content
This archive is organized as such that it follows the steps needed to reproduce the study that was carried out:

- `datasets` -  collection and preprocessing of six systematic review datasets.
- `simulation_study` 
  - requirements file
  - hyperopt
  - simulation
- `results` - the simulation study output processed and analyzed to arrive at the results discussed in the manuscript. 
- `manuscript` - a set of Rmarkdown files who contain the written text in the manuscript and references. 

And contains the following additional folders: 

- `meetings` - minutes of weekly decisions that were made during the research process. Minutes are available until 12 March 2020 due to Utrecht University closing because of the covid-19 crisis. 
- `other` - containing the ethical approval form by the FETC, and the grant approval by SURFsara.
