  abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile (`AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying (`DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.},

A single-lead ECG was recorded by using the AliveCor heart monitor with tracings reviewed subsequently by 2 cardiologists to provide the reference standard.

The global burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown.

Methods and Results
We systematically reviewed population-based studies of AF published 1980\textendash{}2010, from the 21 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions to estimate global/regional prevalence, incidence, as well as morbidity and mortality related to AF (DisModMR software). Of 377 potential studies identified, 184 met pre-specified eligibility criteria. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2010 was 33{$\cdot$}5 million [(20{$\cdot$}9 million males (UI, 19{$\cdot$}5\textendash{}22{$\cdot$}2 million) and 12{$\cdot$}6 million females (UI, 12{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}13{$\cdot$}7 million)]. Burden associated with AF, measured as disability adjusted life-years (DALYs), increased by 18{$\cdot$}8\% (UI, 15{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}19{$\cdot$}3) in males and 18{$\cdot$}9\% (UI, 15{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}23{$\cdot$}5) in females, from 1990 to 2010. In 1990, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence rates of AF (per 100,000 population) were 569{$\cdot$}5 in males [95\% uncertainty interval (UI), 532{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}612{$\cdot$}7] and 359{$\cdot$}9 in females (UI, 334{$\cdot$}7\textendash{}392{$\cdot$}6); the estimated age-adjusted incidence rates were 60{$\cdot$}7/100,000 person-years in males (UI, 49{$\cdot$}2\textendash{}78{$\cdot$}5) and 43{$\cdot$}8 in females (UI, 35{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}55{$\cdot$}0). In 2010 the prevalence rate increased to 596{$\cdot$}2 (UI, 558{$\cdot$}4\textendash{}636{$\cdot$}7) in males and 373{$\cdot$}1 (UI, 347{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}402{$\cdot$}2) in females; incidence rate increased to 77{$\cdot$}5 (UI, 65{$\cdot$}2\textendash{}95{$\cdot$}4) in males and 59{$\cdot$}5 (UI, 49{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}74{$\cdot$}9) in females. Mortality associated with AF was higher in females, and increased by 2-fold (UI, 2{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}2{$\cdot$}2) and 1{$\cdot$}9-fold (UI, 1{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}2{$\cdot$}0) in males and females, respectively, from 1990 to 2010.

Conclusions
These findings provide evidence of progressive increases in overall burden, incidence, prevalence and AF-associated mortality between 1990\textendash{}2010. Systematic, global surveillance of AF is required to better direct prevention and treatment strategies.},

PPG signals collected via mobile devices are prone to artifacts that negatively impact measurement accuracy, which can lead to a significant number of misleading diagnoses. Given the rapidly increased use of mobile devices to collect PPG signals, developing an optimal signal quality index (SQI) is essential to classify the signal quality from these devices. Eight SQIs were developed and tested based on: perfusion, kurtosis, skewness, relative power, non-stationarity, zero crossing, entropy, and the matching of systolic wave detectors. Two independent annotators annotated all PPG data (106 recordings, 60 s each) and a third expert conducted the adjudication of differences. The independent annotators labeled each PPG signal with one of the following labels: excellent, acceptable or unfit for diagnosis. All indices were compared using Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. The skewness index outperformed the other seven indices in differentiating between excellent PPG and acceptable, acceptable combined with unfit, and unfit recordings, with overall     F 1     scores of 86.0\%, 87.2\%, and 79.1\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based monitoring devices will probably play a decisive role in healthcare environment of the future, which will be preventive, predictive, personalized and participatory. Indeed, this optical technology presents several practical advantages over gold standard methods based on electrocardiography, because PPG wearable devices can be comfortably used for long-term continuous monitoring during daily life activities. Contactless video-based PPG technique, also known as imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG), has also attracted much attention recently. In that case, the cardiac pulse is remotely measured from the subtle skin color changes resulting from the blood circulation, using a simple video camera. PPG/iPPG have a lot of potential for a wide range of cardiovascular applications. Hence, there is a substantial need for signal processing techniques to explore these applications and to improve the reliability of the PPG/iPPG-based parameters. A part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of robust processing schemes to estimate heart rate from the PPG/iPPG signals. The proposed approaches were built on adaptive frequency tracking algorithms that were previously developed in our group. These tools, based on adaptive band-pass filters, provide instantaneous frequency estimates of the input signal(s) with a very low time delay, making them suitable for real-time applications. In case of conventional PPG, a prior adaptive noise cancellation step involving the use of accelerometer signals was also necessary to reconstruct clean PPG signals during the regions corrupted by motion artifacts. Regarding iPPG, after comparing different regions of interest on the subject face, we hypothesized that the simultaneous use of different iPPG signal derivation methods (i.e. methods to derive the iPPG time series from the pixel values of the consecutive frames) could be advantageous. Methods to assess signal quality online and to incorporate it into instantaneous frequency estimation were also examined and successfully applied to improve system reliability. This thesis also explored different innovative applications involving PPG/iPPG signals. The detection of atrial fibrillation was studied. Novel features derived directly from the PPG waveforms, designed to reflect the morphological changes observed during arrhythmic episodes, were proposed and proven to be successful for atrial fibrillation detection. Arrhythmia detection and robust heart rate estimation approaches were combined in another study aimed at reducing the number of false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit by exploiting signals from independent sources, including PPG. Evaluation on a hidden dataset demonstrated that the number of false alarms was drastically reduced while almost no true alarm was suppressed. Finally, other aspects of the iPPG technology were examined, such as the measurement of pulse rate variability indexes from the iPPG signals and the estimation of respiratory rate from the iPPG interbeat intervals.},

  abstract = {Background
Screening of atrial fibrillation (AF) for high-risk patients including all patients aged 65 years and older is important for prevention of risk of stroke. Different technologies such as modified blood pressure monitor, single lead ECG-based finger-probe, and smart phone using plethysmogram signal have been emerging for this purpose. All these technologies use irregularity of heartbeat duration as a feature for AF detection. We have investigated a normalization method of heartbeat duration for improved AF detection.
Method
AF is an arrhythmia in which heartbeat duration generally becomes irregularly irregular. From a window of heartbeat duration, we estimate the possible rhythm of the majority of heartbeats and normalize duration of all heartbeats in the window based on the rhythm so that we can measure the irregularity of heartbeats for both AF and non-AF rhythms in the same scale. Irregularity is measured by the entropy of distribution of the normalized duration. Then we classify a window of heartbeats as AF or non-AF by thresholding the measured irregularity. The effect of this normalization is evaluated by comparing AF detection performances using duration with the normalization, without normalization, and with other existing normalizations.
Results
Sensitivity and specificity of AF detection using normalized heartbeat duration were tested on two landmark databases available online and compared with results of other methods (with/without normalization) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC analysis showed that the normalization was able to improve the performance of AF detection and it was consistent for a wide range of sensitivity and specificity for use of different thresholds. Detection accuracy was also computed for equal rates of sensitivity and specificity for different methods. Using normalized heartbeat duration, we obtained 96.38\% accuracy which is more than 4\% improvement compared to AF detection without normalization.
Conclusions
The proposed normalization method was found useful for improving performance and robustness of AF detection. Incorporation of this method in a screening device could be crucial to reduce the risk of AF-related stroke. In general, the incorporation of the rhythm-based normalization in an AF detection method seems important for developing a robust AF screening device.},

Unfortunately, pulse oximetry is prone to artifacts which negatively impact the accuracy of the measurement and can cause a significant number of false alarms. We have developed an algorithm to segment pulse oximetry signals into pulses and estimate the signal quality in real time. The algorithm iteratively calculates a signal quality index (SQI) ranging from 0 to 100. In the presence of artifacts and irregular signal morphology, the algorithm outputs a low SQI number. The pulse segmentation algorithm uses the derivative of the signal to find pulse slopes and an adaptive set of repeated Gaussian filters to select the correct slopes. Cross-correlation of consecutive pulse segments is used to estimate signal quality. Experimental results using two different benchmark data sets showed a good pulse detection rate with a sensitivity of 96.21\% and a positive predictive value of 99.22\%, which was equivalent to the available reference algorithm. The novel SQI algorithm was effective and produced significantly lower SQI values in the presence of artifacts compared to SQI values during clean signals. The SQI algorithm may help to guide untrained pulse oximeter users and also help in the design of advanced algorithms for generating smart alarms.},

January 2016 marked a turning point, as news of two class-action lawsuits filed against major manufacturer Fitbit brought widespread attention to accuracy, reliability, and safety concerns regarding these devices. This Article will provide a concise overview of optical heart rate monitoring technology, the current state of the art, and research trends. It will be argued that under real-world scenarios these apps and devices are currently inherently inaccurate and unreliable, with even greater problems on the horizon as the industry shifts towards areas such as heart rate variability monitoring or the detection of cardiac arrhythmias.

These apps involve either the use of (1) photoplethysmographic recording or (2) a handheld external electrocardiographic recording device attached to the mobile phone or wristband. Objective: This review seeks to explore the current state of mobile phone apps in cardiac rhythmology while highlighting shortcomings for further research. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of the use of mobile phone devices by searching PubMed and EMBASE from their inception to October 2018. Potentially relevant papers were then compared against a checklist for relevance and reviewed independently for inclusion, with focus on 4 allocated topics of (1) mobile phone monitoring, (2) AF, (3) HR, and (4) HR variability (HRV). Results: The findings of this narrative review suggest that there is a role for mobile phone apps in the diagnosis, monitoring, and screening for arrhythmias and HR. Photoplethysmography and handheld electrocardiograph recorders are the 2 main techniques adopted in monitoring HR, HRV, and AF. Conclusions: A number of studies have demonstrated high accuracy of a number of different mobile devices for the detection of AF. However, further studies are warranted to validate their use for large scale AF screening.  [JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2019;7(2):e11606]},

However, measuring these indices often requires laborious processes. We therefore developed a new smartphone program, named iPhysioMeter, that makes it possible to measure beat-by-beat HR and ln NPV using only a smartphone. We examined its accuracy against conventional laboratory measures. Mental stress tasks were used to alter HR and ln NPV in 12 participants. Bland\textendash{}Altman analyses revealed negligible proportional bias for HR and ln NPV or for their change values, expressed as {$\Delta$}HR and {$\Delta$}ln NPV. However, a relatively large fixed bias did emerge for ln NPV, as well as a small one for {$\Delta$}ln NPV, although both were within the limits of agreement. These findings suggest that iPhysioMeter can yield valid measures of the absolute level of HR and of relative changes in ln NPV.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning system for automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulse waveforms.
Methods We trained a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect AF in 17 s PPG waveforms using a training data set of 149 048 PPG waveforms constructed from several publicly available PPG databases. The DCNN was validated using an independent test data set of 3039 smartphone-acquired PPG waveforms from adults at high risk of AF at a general outpatient clinic against ECG tracings reviewed by two cardiologists. Six established AF detectors based on handcrafted features were evaluated on the same test data set for performance comparison.
Results In the validation data set (3039 PPG waveforms) consisting of three sequential PPG waveforms from 1013 participants (mean (SD) age, 68.4 (12.2) years; 46.8\% men), the prevalence of AF was 2.8\%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the DCNN for AF detection was 0.997 (95\% CI 0.996 to 0.999) and was significantly higher than all the other AF detectors (AUC range: 0.924\textendash{}0.985). The sensitivity of the DCNN was 95.2\% (95\% CI 88.3\% to 98.7\%), specificity was 99.0\% (95\% CI 98.6\% to 99.3\%), positive predictive value (PPV) was 72.7\% (95\% CI 65.1\% to 79.3\%) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.9\% (95\% CI 99.7\% to 100\%) using a single 17 s PPG waveform. Using the three sequential PPG waveforms in combination ({$<$}1 min in total), the sensitivity was 100.0\% (95\% CI 87.7\% to 100\%), specificity was 99.6\% (95\% CI 99.0\% to 99.9\%), PPV was 87.5\% (95\% CI 72.5\% to 94.9\%) and NPV was 100\% (95\% CI 99.4\% to 100\%).
Conclusions In this evaluation of PPG waveforms from adults screened for AF in a real-world primary care setting, the DCNN had high sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for detecting AF, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods based on handcrafted features.},

OBJECTIVE: This study tested the diagnostic accuracy of the FibriCheck AF algorithm for the detection of AF on the basis of mobile phone PPG and single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) signals.
METHODS: A convenience sample of patients aged 65 years and above, with or without a known history of AF, was recruited from 17 primary care facilities. Patients with an active pacemaker rhythm were excluded. A PPG signal was obtained with the rear camera of an iPhone 5S. Simultaneously, a single-lead ECG was registered using a dermal patch with a wireless connection to the same mobile phone. PPG and single-lead ECG signals were analyzed using the FibriCheck AF algorithm. At the same time, a 12-lead ECG was obtained and interpreted offline by independent cardiologists to determine the presence of AF.
RESULTS: A total of 45.7\% (102/223) subjects were having AF. PPG signal quality was sufficient for analysis in 93\% and single-lead ECG quality was sufficient in 94\% of the participants. After removing insufficient quality measurements, the sensitivity and specificity were 96\% (95\% CI 89\%-99\%) and 97\% (95\% CI 91\%-99\%) for the PPG signal versus 95\% (95\% CI 88\%-98\%) and 97\% (95\% CI 91\%-99\%) for the single-lead ECG, respectively. False-positive results were mainly because of premature ectopic beats. PPG and single-lead ECG techniques yielded adequate signal quality in 196 subjects and a similar diagnosis in 98.0\% (192/196) subjects.

  abstract = {Background: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a proven way to measure heart rate (HR). This technology is already available in smartphones, which allows measuring HR only by using the smartphone. Given the widespread availability of smartphones, this creates a scalable way to enable mobile HR monitoring. An essential precondition is that these technologies are as reliable and accurate as the current clinical (gold) standards. At this moment, there is no consensus on a gold standard method for the validation of HR apps. This results in different validation processes that do not always reflect the veracious outcome of comparison. Objective: The aim of this paper was to investigate and describe the necessary elements in validating and comparing HR apps versus standard technology. Methods: The FibriCheck (Qompium) app was used in two separate prospective nonrandomized studies. In the first study, the HR of the FibriCheck app was consecutively compared with 2 different Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared HR devices: the Nonin oximeter and the AliveCor Mobile ECG. In the second study, a next step in validation was performed by comparing the beat-to-beat intervals of the FibriCheck app to a synchronized ECG recording. Results: In the first study, the HR (BPM, beats per minute) of 88 random subjects consecutively measured with the 3 devices showed a correlation coefficient of .834 between FibriCheck and Nonin, .88 between FibriCheck and AliveCor, and .897 between Nonin and AliveCor. A single way analysis of variance (ANOVA; P=.61 was executed to test the hypothesis that there were no significant differences between the HRs as measured by the 3 devices. In the second study, 20,298 (ms) R-R intervals (RRI)\textendash{}peak-to-peak intervals (PPI) from 229 subjects were analyzed. This resulted in a positive correlation (rs=.993, root mean square deviation [RMSE]=23.04 ms, and normalized root mean square error [NRMSE]=0.012) between the PPI from FibriCheck and the RRI from the wearable ECG. There was no significant difference (P=.92) between these intervals. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the most suitable method for the validation of an HR app is a simultaneous measurement of the HR by the smartphone app and an ECG system, compared on the basis of beat-to-beat analysis. This approach could lead to more correct assessments of the accuracy of HR apps.  [JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2017;5(8):e129]},

  abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive performance in classifica- tion is surprising, because the conditional independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in real- world applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependen- cies of all nodes work together, consistently (support- ing a certain classification) or inconsistently (cancel- ing each other out), plays a crucial role. Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute evenly in classes, or if the dependences can- cel each other out. We propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore when naive Bayes works well.},
