# List of Definitions
Model. 

:   The prediction model for Active learning 

        some code, part of Definition 2

    Third paragraph of definition 2.
    
Query Strategy 
:   The way papers are queried to the researcher 

        query_strategy
        

    Uncertainty sampling
    :  Selects the least sure instances for labelling. 
    
    Maximum sampling
    :  Selects the samples with the highest prediction probability.
    
    Random and maximum sampling. 
    :  Combination of random and maximum sampling. By default samples the 95% of the instances with max sampling, and 5% of the samples with random sampling.

<!-- # The Last Appendix -->

<!-- This first appendix includes all of the R chunks of code that were hidden throughout the document (using the `include = FALSE` chunk tag) to help with readibility and/or setup. -->

<!-- **In the main Rmd file** -->

<!-- ```{r ref.label='include_packages', results='hide', echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **In Chapter \@ref(ref-labels):** -->

<!-- ```{r ref.label='include_packages_2', results='hide', echo = TRUE} -->
