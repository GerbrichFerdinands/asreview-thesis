Goal: evaluate performance of different models of the ASReview tool. 

### Stage 1: hyperparameter optimization
We are testing 5 models on 5 different datasets. 

Every model has its own set of hyperparameters.
The hyperparameters are optimized on the 5 datasets in three different ways: 

- 1 on 1: maximum performance 
- 4 on 1: cross-validation 
- 5 on 1: more data = more better? 

This results $(5+5+1)*5$ sets of hyperparameters. 

### Stage 2: simulation
for every for every model (5), for every dataset (5) and for every set of optimized hyperparameters (3), a simulation study is performed. From these $5*5*3=75$ simulation studies, performance of the different models is evaluated.


## Scripts 
  - simulatie:
- [ ] script die optimalisatie genereert (config files.)
- [ ] script die `.ini`'s voor simulatie genereert.
