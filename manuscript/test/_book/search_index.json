Every model has its own set of hyperparameters. The hyperparameters are optimized on the 5 datasets in three different ways: 1 on 1: maximum performance 4 on 1: cross-validation 5 on 1: more data = more better? This results \\((5+5+1)*5\\) sets of hyperparameters. 1.0.2 Stage 2: simulation for every for every model (5), for every dataset (5) and for every set of optimized hyperparameters (3), a simulation study is performed. From these \\(5*5*3=75\\) simulation studies, performance of the different models is evaluated. 1.1 Scripts simulatie: script die optimalisatie genereert (config files.) script die .iniâ€™s voor simulatie genereert.
