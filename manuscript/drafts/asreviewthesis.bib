In each sysrev users can screen articles in their corpus by marking them as an
'include' or 'exclude'. ~While reviewing a sysrev screening model is silently
learning how to replicate reviewer decisions. ~Screening models can help
accelerate the review process and eventually automate reviews. ~Automated
reviews will be a key step in the updateable 'living' reviews talked that will
be the next frontier for document rev},

Screening titles and abstracts (T\&Ab) for inclusion in a systematic review is an intensive, and often collaborative, step. The use of appropriate tools is therefore important. In this study, we identified and evaluated the usability of software tools that support T\&Ab screening for systematic reviews within healthcare research.},
