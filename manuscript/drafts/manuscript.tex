Systematic Reviews (SR's) are booming - but they are a lot of work
Various machine learning tools have been proposed to reduce workload in
abstract screening.

This study is about how machine learning algorithms can increase
efficiency in systematic reviews. I will write about what SRs are, and
how workload can be reduced.

Systematic reviews are top of the bill in research. As more and more
papers are published and reproducibility crisis has emerged, science
calls for more meta. It is important reflect on research by giving an
overview of research areas which is typically done by a systematic
review {[}\ldots{]}. Performing a systematic review is a tedious and
time-consuming task. To review a specific research area, one starts out
with an initial search of thousands of academic papers. All these papers
abstracts need to be screened to find an initial batch of possibly
relevant papers. With now hopefully only a couple of hundred papers
left, the researcher needs to read these papers full-text to arrive at a
final selection of papers that are relevant for the final systematic
review {[}this is prisma process?{]}. This whole processes costs this
and this much time {[}shelmilt{]}.

The stage of abstract screening where abstracts are systematically
screened is where a lot is to be gained. This stage is the target of
possible learning algorithms that can assist the reviewer in selecting
the relevant papers. Together with the reviewer /human machine
interaction. The algorithm aims to compute which papers in the pool need
to be excluded and which need to be included, based on the reviewers
decisions. It learns from the reviewers decisions and asks the reviewer
to provide more labels, incrementally improving its class predictions.

The goal of the algorithm defined in the current study is to reduce to
number of abstracts needed to screen (maybe not right term, bit
biomedical). To be more specific, the algorithm aims to present the
reader with the primary studies as soon as possible. This means that at
some point you probably have seen all relevant abstracts and are only
viewing excluded papers, which means you can stop reviewing much earlier
(theoretically spoken). Also reviewing is now much more fun. As compared
to when you have to review all abstracts and you perhaps see only one
relevant abstract every other week/day.

So you might wonder, how does such an algorithm actually work? Active
learning strategy, starting with a pool of unlabeled abstracts (U). The
reviewer starts labeling some instances in U, creating L. The algorithm
utilizes L to predict labels for all abstracts (classifier), by using a
set of features from the papers called X, for example the text in the
abstract (feature extraction method). Now, it made an initial
classification. The algorithm now aims to improve its classification by
which paper from U will be presented to the reviewer next. By labeling
the next paper, the reviewer provides the algorithm with new information
which the algorithm uses to update its prediction.

We approach asr as a classification problem: All papers obtained in the
systematic search form a pool of instances x. All instances x need to be
classified, e.g.~we want to give them a label y. all x are now part of
U,. Binary classification, either inclusion or exclusion. We want to
classify based on some features from the instances \(x\), feature vector
\(\mathbf{X}\).

By starting of with L, the algorithm utilizes characteristics of X to
predict labels in U.

We want to classify the papers in Where the whole collection of papers
in the systematic search form a pool of instances x, with unknown label
y. \textless x,y\textgreater.

\begin{verbatim}
input: a pool of unlabeled abstracts $\mathcal{U}$ 
oracle labels a few initial papers, from $\mathcal{U}$, $\mathcal{L}$, 
  
  M = train($\mathcal{L}$)
  query x \isin 
  
  
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  pool unlabeled abstracts \(\mathcal{U}\)
\item
  labeled data set \(\mathcal{L}\),
\item
  instance \(x\), label \(y\)
\item
  utility measure \(\phi_A(\cdot)\)
\item
  \(x^*_A\) best query instance according to \(\phi_A(\cdot)\)
\end{itemize}

Now there are a few technical details. Many different versions of such
algorithms exist. Many of such algorithms have been described in the
active learning literature and have been applied in the systematic
reviewing process. Not exhaustive, but the algorithm can apply many
different strategies to arrive at its predictions, which can be divided
in following parameters: classifier, feature extraction strategy,
balancing, query strategy.

Most often the SVM classifier is used, popular and very good results.
Also lots of other configurations. However, other classifiers have not
been tested a lot (polygon thing by cohe, na√Øve bayes and random forest
by \ldots), but mostly SVM still. Also, most research in the medical
sciences (well there are some exceptions of course {[}conversation
between cohen and matwill{]}

In the current study, we aim at exploring the performance of several
classifiers on reducing workload while maintaining performance in
abstract screening process. This is done by performing simulations on
existing systematic reviews. Performance is evaluated by how much time
can be saved \ldots{} while maintaining accuracy.

Present research questions. RQ1 -- which classifiers perform best? -
RQ1a -- does classifier performance vary over different research areas?
(in what terms does it perform best)

RQ2 different hyperparameter optimizations? Classifiers come with
hyperparameters. We have to make a choice on how to set these
hyperparameters. What we do is create 3 sets, optimizing in three ways,
aggregate results obtained.

The goal is to gain insight in classifiers other than the widely applied
SVM, overall various research areas. So not only medical sciences.

To perform all these computations the research was carried out using the
ASReview software by Utrecht University, which has a simulation mode
that you can just input your labelled review file into and perform a
simulation study with it. To be found on GitHub. It has many adjustable
components/is very versatile.

Then if we still have time left we explore the effect of another feature
extraction method, namely doc2vec. This might possibly increase
performance as it performs better at grasping structure/hidden
relations/hierarchy between words in the texts. So, it could be
interesting in more `fuzzy' research areas. A downside is that it takes
more computing time.

Then if there's even more time we might want to compare a different
balance strategy.

A SR can be divided into phases. Everything starts with a
\textbf{systematic search}, leading to then citation screening is
performed, then full-text screening (PRISMA-P Group et al. 2015)

What must be the objective of our tool?: It is the tedious task citation
screening part where loads of time can be saved.

models are designed in a `realistic' way (you have some inclusions)

Selecting papers is a two-step process: abstract \& fulltext screening

Binary classification problem. predict whether a paper in the pool is an
inclusion or exclusion, based on labeled instances from \(\mathcal{L}\)
and use training data to understand how input variables are related to
class.

We're building active learning model who takes X as an input an predicts
class using labels from training set. Model improves by deciding asking
more information from the reviewer (oracle), accounting for imbalance.

negative outweighs the cost of a false positive. Note that we assume the
oracle/original user to hold the truth. This is of course not always the
case.

There are two classes in the data: exlusions and inclusions. The
inclusions are clearly the minority class.

`strict'/`structured' and social sciences more messy.

used in identifying method- ologically rigorous studies, boosting
consistently strikes the best balance between precision and recall,
whereas naive Bayes in general performs well on recall (demonstrating a
tradeoff between recall and precision), as does polynomial SVM on
precision. The AUC results are mixed, although boosting has a slight
edge overall. These results demonstrate that different classifiers can
be used to satisfy different information needs (SVM for specificity,
naive Bayes for sensitivity, and boosting for balance between the two,
for example).''

Our extensions is that we try different classifiers, on more datasets.

Goal: evaluate performance of different models of the ASReview tool. The
screening process is simulated using ASReview, seeing if the original
inclusions replicate. What would happen if the citation screening would
have been performed using asreview? All datasets accompanying the
systematic reviews are openly published.

\hypertarget{datasets}{%
\subsection{Datasets}\label{datasets}}

The algorithm will be tested on five systematic reviews from various
research areas. test datasets serve as systematic search results, then
perform active learning to detect inclusions.

Cohen et al.~collected systematic review datasets from the medical
sciences (Cohen et al. 2006). All systematic reviews in this database
are on drug efficacy. The \emph{ace} dataset used in the current study
comes from a systematic review on the efficacy of Angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

The \emph{software} dataset is retrieved from (Yu, Kraft, and Menzies
2018), who collected datasets on literature reviews from the software
engineering field. This dataset is on fault prediction in software
engineering by (Hall et al. 2012).

The \emph{nudging} dataset comes from a review from the behavioural
public administration area. The SR includes studies on nudging
healthcare professionals (Nagtegaal et al. 2019a). The data was stored
on the Harvard Dataverse (Nagtegaal et al. 2019b).

A literature review from field of psychology, \emph{ptsd}. The SR is on
studies applying latent trajectory analyses on posttraumatic stress
after exposure to trauma (\noopsort{schoot}van de Schoot et al. 2017).
The corresponding data can be found on the Open Science Framework
{[}\ldots{]}.

\emph{wilson}, a dataset from the medical sciences (Appenzeller-Herzog
2020). TA review on effectiveness treatments of Wilson disease
(Appenzeller-Herzog et al. 2019).

All datasets started with an initial pool of thousands of papers. A
fraction of these papers where deemed relevant for the SR, with
inclusion rates around 1-2 percent with one outlier of about 5 percent
(Table 1).

The raw datafiles published with the SRs were preprocessed into a test
dataset. The test datasets contain title information on all citations
obtained in the search strategy. The instances in the data consist of a
title, an abstract and were labeled to indicate which citations were
included in the systematic review. Instances with missing abstracts were
removed. Duplicate instances were removed. Preprocessing scripts can be
found on the GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/GerbrichFerdinands/asreview-thesis}}

\hypertarget{models}{%
\subsection{Models}\label{models}}

Five different active learning models were build. Every model \(m\) was
used to perform an automated systematic review on SR dataset \(d\). The
models all apply a different classifier \(c\) with its own set of
(hyper)parameters \(h\).

\hypertarget{classifiers}{%
\paragraph{Classifiers}\label{classifiers}}

The classifier predicts the class of all papers, given the training
dataset/labeled data set \(\mathcal{L}\).

Given the labels and some features from all abstracts in the pool, the
classifier To predict whether a paper should be an exclusion or an
inclusion, different classifiers

Logistic Regression (L) -

Naive Bayes (B) - predicts the class of an instance given input features
\(\mathbf{X}\). Naive Bayes assumes all features are independent given
the class value. This is obviously not the case but still the algorithm
performs impressively (Zhang 2004). Especially at \ldots{} tasks.

Random Forests (R) is where a large number of decision trees are fit on
bootstrapped samples of the original data. All trees cast a vote on the
class, which are aggregated into a class prediciton for each input
\(\mathbf{X}\) (Breiman 2001).

Support Vecor Machine (S) - finds a multidimensional hyperplane to
separate classes. (Tong and Koller 2001)

Dense Neural Network (N) -

Besides \(c\), components of \(m\) are fea

To summarize, every model \(m\) consists of the following key
components: classifier, feature extraction strategy, query strategy,
balance strategy.

For example \(M_1\) BTMD (naive bayes, tfidf, certainty sampling, double
balance) STMD

\hypertarget{word-representation}{%
\paragraph{Word representation}\label{word-representation}}

To be able to predict whether a paper needs to be included or excluded
(e.g.~to predict class), the classifier needs some features from the
papers.\\
As features we use the title and abstract from every paper - this is
what is prescribed by prisma, (check!) The classifier cannot predict the
paper class from the raw titles and abstracts as they are. Therefore,
the content of the texts needs to be transformed into numerical
representations called feature vectors.

A classical example is a `bag of words' representation. For each each
text, the number of occurrences of each word is stored. This leads to n
features, where n is the number of distinct words in the texts
(Pedregosa et al. 2011). The bag-of-words method is simplistic and will
highly value often occuring but otherwise meaningless words such as
``and''. Term-frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) (Ramos and
others 2003) circumvents this problem by adjusting a term frequency in a
text with the inverse docuement frequency, the frequency of a given word
in the entire corpus.

\hypertarget{rebalancing-the-training-set}{%
\paragraph{Rebalancing the training
set}\label{rebalancing-the-training-set}}

To account for class imbalance in the data, the model can apply several
strategies to rebalance the training set.

A reweighting strategy is applied where inclusions (the minority class)
are weighted more heavily than the exclusions.

When no balancing is applied, the training data set = labeled data set
\(\mathcal{L}\)

The initial training set consists of 5 inclusions and 5 exclusions,
randomly sampled from the dataset. We use 5 inclusions and exclusions as
we assume the researcher has some prior knowledge on this. The
researcher has some prior knowledge about the pool, some papers ought to
be included in the SR.

For every model*data combination, 3 sets of hyperparameters are

For every model, the hyperparameters are optimized three times, arriving
at three versions of the model:

We now have 75 combinations. for every for every model (5), for every
dataset (5) and for every set of optimized hyperparameters (3), a
simulation study consisting trials is performed. From these \(5*5*3=75\)
simulation studies, performance of the different models is evaluated.

A simulation is of one model on one dataset. The simulation is repeated
for 10 trials \(t\).

Every simulation study consists of 10 trials, to account for the
randomness of prior inclusions and exclusions. So every trial the prior
inclusions and exclusions are randomly selected. Results are aggregated

The goal is twofold: we want to identify all relevant papers, as fast as
we can. Tradeoff: identifying all relevant papers and reducing workload.
A good metric to evaluate this is..

What is more important: recall or precision?

Recall more highly valued than precision.

What about class imbalance?

500,000 SBU

Running on Cartesius is charged in System Billing Units (SBUs), and
charging is based on the wall clock time of a job. On fat and thin
nodes, an SBU is equal to using 1 core for 1 hour (a core hour), or 1
core for 20 minutes on a GPU node. Since compute nodes are allocated
exclusively to a single job at a time, you will be charged for all cores
on that node - even if you are using less.
