Processing simulation output
================

This directory stores all files used to extract figures and statistics
from the simulation study output. The directory contains the following:

  - `extract_plots.ipynb`, a jupyter notebook producing recall curves
    from the simulation output (Figure 1 and 2 in the manuscript)
  - `extract_results.ipynb`, a jupyter notebook extracting `.json` files
    containing statistics from the `.h5` simulation output (WSS, RRF,
    ATD in table 2, 3, and 4 in the manuscript)
  - `one_seed`, containing all plots and `.json` statistics files
    produced by the two jupyter notebooks above. The plots are used in
    the manuscript, the data are further processed by this readme into
    tables before they are manuscript-ready.
  - `README.Rmd` containing R-code to transform the `.json` files into
    readable tables for the manuscript.
  - `output` contains the abovementioned tables, stored as `.RDS` files.

# Requirements

Extracing data from the simulation output requires having several
packages installed, like ASReview version 0.9.3 \[@ASReview2020\]. All
these requirements are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. If youâ€™ve
already installed this file in the `simulation_study` step, please skip
this. If not, you can run the following in your terminal to install all
requirements:

Additionally, to create the plots and statistics in the manuscript you
will need to install a specific branch of the asreview visualization
package. Run the following in your terminal:

And then, within the newly created directory, the following:

## Define functions for reading simulation output

## Load results for 15 separate trials

Compute standarad deviation from the 15 separate trials.

## Load results as means over all 15 trials

Create table for manuscript (all means over 15 runs)
